              "id: 4. Click Continue. You’re ready to begin using RStudio. Downloading the Datasets and Example Code This book is about using R and Python to perform machine science tasks. Of course, you can spend all your time creating the example code from scratch, debugging it, and only then discovering how it relates to machine learning, or you can take the easy way and download the prewritten code so that you can get right to work. Likewise, creating datasets large enough for machine learning purposes would take quite a while. Fortunately, you can access standardized, precreated data sets quite easily using features provided in some of the machine learning libraries. The following sections help you download and use the example code and datasets so that you can save time and get right to work with machine learning– specific tasks. Understanding the datasets used in this book Most of the datasets used in this book come directly from the R datasets package. You can find a listing of these datasets at https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/ R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html . If you want to see these data - sets in RStudio, simply type data() in a blank file, and the IDE shows it to you. Figure 4-11 shows typical output from typing data() . 60 PART 2 Preparing Your Learning ToolsIn addition to these standard datasets, the book uses supplemental datasets. In many cases, these supplemental datasets are the same as those used for Python examples and let you compare the output of R to Python. These supplemental datasets are »Boston: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/ html/Boston.html »Air Quality (airquality): https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/ library/datasets/html/airquality.html »Titanic: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/ html/Titanic.html »Iris: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/ html/iris.html »SMS Spam Collection (sms_data): http://www.dt.fee.unicamp. br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/ In most cases, you download and use a special dataset by using a permutation of the data() function that includes the name of the dataset and the package in which it resides. For example, to use the Boston dataset, you use the data(Boston, package=“MASS”) function call. The book explores the use of datasets as needed. Defining the code repository The code you create and use in this book will reside in a repository on your hard drive. Think of a repository as a kind of filing cabinet where you put your code. RStudio makes working with a repository easy. You essentially use the same structure that you always use to store files on your system. The following sections describe how to set up RStudio for use with this book. Defining the book’s folder It pays to organize your files so that you can access them more easily later.
